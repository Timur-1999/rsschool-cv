##About self
My goal is to become an IT specialist, as I believe that this profession will help me travel around the world. I am a creative, friendly, conscientious, well-rounded person. Interest in creating a website and programming a web application appeared last year in the spring. At the institute, I came across the topic of creating a game for the development of children's logic. And then I faced such a problem how should I do this work and the idea came to mind what if I write a game in the form of a web application. And I began to study the documentation for creating a web application. I liked it so much that in the summer I bought courses to master this technology well, and over the summer I learned how to make up websites well and mastered the basic knowledge of the JavaScript programming language. That's why I liked this technology as "Front-end" and I want to achieve great success in this technology, thereby growing to a good level.
